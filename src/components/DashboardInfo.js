            After starting off in <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, I began learning&nbsp; 
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It's now become my preferred language,
            but it is by no means the only one I use.  And I'm always down to pick up something new. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a freelance web developer, I draw from an extensive toolkit to fit my client needs.
            These days, I'm working with (and loving) <strong>React</strong>.  
            If the project calls for it, I'll incorporate <strong>Redux</strong> into the mix.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to <strong>JavaScript</strong> I'm also well-versed in various web tools like 
            &nbsp;<strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong> as well as <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, 
            &nbsp;<strong>jQuery</strong>, and technologies such as <strong>AJAX</strong> and <strong>Firebase</strong>.
            I also have experience with <strong>Wordpress</strong>, as well as <strong>PHP</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the backend, I'm a big fan of <strong>NodeJS</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, 
            though I am comfortable using <strong>SQL</strong> databases as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I am not specifically a graphic designer, I am experienced with tools such as 
            &nbsp;<strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>, <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>, and 
            most recently <strong>Sketch</strong>.  On that note, I also believe I have an eye - or more appropriately, a feel - for good <strong>UX and UI</strong> experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I have professioanl experience using a myrid of video and audio editing software as well as writing for
            digital media.  I'm always looking for my next big challenge, and I would be happy to hear from you soon.
